# 📐 High-Level Architecture Proposal for Scalable Product API

## 1. Deployment: Kubernetes (k8s) Environment

- **Containerization:**  
  - Package the .NET 8 Product API using Docker.  
  - Use a multi-stage Dockerfile for smaller, secure images.

- **Pod Management & Scaling:**  
  - Deploy the container as a Kubernetes Deployment.
  - Use ReplicaSets for high availability.
  - Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale pods based on CPU/memory or custom metrics.
  - Use Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP/LoadBalancer) for service discovery and load balancing.

- **Service Discovery:**  
  - Internal services communicate via DNS names provided by Kubernetes Services.
  - External access via Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX Ingress) with HTTPS termination.

## 2. Data Storage: Persistent & Scalable

- **Production Choice:**  
  - Use a managed relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Azure SQL, Amazon RDS) for strong consistency, ACID transactions, and structured data.
  - For high write/read throughput or flexible schema, consider a NoSQL solution (e.g., MongoDB, Cosmos DB).

- **Justification:**  
  - Relational DBs are ideal for transactional product data and support scaling via read replicas and partitioning.
  - NoSQL is suitable for unstructured or rapidly evolving data but may sacrifice consistency for availability/performance.

- **Scaling Challenges:**  
  - Use connection pooling, sharding, and read replicas for scaling.
  - Regularly back up data and monitor for performance bottlenecks.

## 3. Caching: Distributed Cache for Performance

- **Solution:**  
  - Integrate a distributed cache (e.g., Redis, Aerospike) to store frequently accessed product data and reduce database load.

- **Caching Strategy:**  
  - Use a cache-aside pattern: check cache first, then database if not found, and update cache after DB read.
  - Set appropriate expiration (TTL) for cache entries.

- **Implementation Points:**  
  - Cache product lists and individual product details.
  - Invalidate or update cache on product create/update/delete.

## 4. Asynchronous Communication: Kafka for Decoupling & Background Tasks

- **Use Cases:**  
  - Publish product creation/update events to Kafka topics for other services (e.g., inventory, analytics, notifications).
  - Process background jobs (e.g., sending emails, updating search indexes) via Kafka consumers.

- **Benefits:**  
  - Decouples services, improves scalability, and enables event-driven architecture.
  - Supports retry, dead-letter queues, and message durability.

**Example Use Case:**  
- On product creation, publish a message to `products-created` topic.
- Inventory and analytics services consume this topic to update their own data asynchronously.

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

- **Monitoring:**  
  - Use Prometheus and Grafana for metrics (CPU, memory, request rates, error rates).
  - Set up Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes for health checks.

- **Logging:**  
  - Use structured logging (e.g., Serilog) and forward logs to a centralized system (e.g., ELK Stack, Azure Monitor, or AWS CloudWatch).
  - Correlate logs with trace IDs for distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger).

---

## 6. Maintainability and Team Collaboration

- **Modularity & Separation of Concerns:**  
  - Organize code into clear layers: Controllers, Services, Repositories, Validators, DTOs.
  - Use interfaces and dependency injection for testability and flexibility.

- **Coding Standards & Collaboration:**  
  - Enforce code style with analyzers and formatters.
  - Use pull requests, code reviews, and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Write unit and integration tests for all modules and end-to-end tests for all business flows.
  - Maintain clear API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).

- **Team Practices:**  
  - Use feature branches and trunk-based development.
  - Document architecture and onboarding guides in the repository.
